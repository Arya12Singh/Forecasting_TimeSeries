# Forecasting_TimeSeries
This project analyzes historical stock prices of Honeywell (HON) and Apple (AAPL) using Excel and R to forecast short-term trends. Techniques applied include exponential smoothing for trend analysis and ARIMA modeling for time series predictions. The project evaluates the impact of smoothing parameters (α and β) and compares the accuracy of predictions using metrics like MAPD and MAPE.

Key insights reveal optimal smoothing parameters for precise forecasting and demonstrate how ARIMA models capture stock price movements, including trends and volatility.
